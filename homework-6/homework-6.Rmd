## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
library(corrr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(rpart.plot)
library(vip)
library(janitor)
library(randomForest)
library(xgboost)
setwd("~/Desktop/PSTAT 131/homework-6")
set.seed(3435)
```

```{r}
pokemon <- read.csv("data/Pokemon.csv")
pokemon <- as_tibble(pokemon)
pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon)
pokemon <- pokemon[pokemon$type_1 %in% c("Bug","Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic"), ]
pokemon$type_1 <- as.factor(pokemon$type_1)
pokemon$legendary <- as.factor(pokemon$legendary)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.7,strata = type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5,strata = type_1)
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense+ hp+sp_def,pokemon_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_center(all_predictors())
```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

```{r}
cor_pokemon <- select_if(pokemon, is.numeric) %>%
  select(-c(x,generation)) %>% correlate()
rplot(cor_pokemon)
```

We exclude ```x``` because it is the index, and ```generation``` because it is not continuous. We see that total is positively correlated to every other variables because it is the sum of all stats. Next we see that there is some positive correlation between ```sp_atk``` and ```attack```, similarly for ```sp_def``` and ```defense```. This means that pokemon have good attacks tend to have good speical attack, making them good for attack. Similar for defense and special defense. 

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_fit <- class_tree_spec %>%
  fit(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense+ hp+sp_def, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```
```{r}
class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~  legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense+ hp+sp_def)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc),
)
autoplot(tune_res)
```

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res),desc(mean))
```

We can see that the best ```roc_auc``` is 0.629 and is achieved when ```cost_complexity``` is 0.0215

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
rand_tree_spec <- rand_forest(
  mode = "classification",
  mtry = tune(),
  trees = tune(),
  min_n = tune()
) %>%
set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity') 

rand_tree_grid <- grid_regular(mtry(c(1,8)),trees(c(16,256)),min_n(c(1,8)),levels = 8)

rand_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rand_tree_spec) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~  legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense+ hp+sp_def)
```

```mtry``` is An integer for the number of predictors that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating the tree models. In our model there is a total of 8 predictors so it can only be an integer between 1 and 8. ```mtry = 8``` is just a decision tree model with all the predictors selected.
  
```trees``` is the number of trees to be grown
  
```min_n``` is the minimum number of observations in a node. 


### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
library(ranger)
rand_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  rand_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = rand_tree_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc),
)
 
autoplot(rand_tune_res)
```

The best ```roc_auc``` is 0.726 and is achieved when ```mtry``` is 2 and ```trees``` is 256 and ```min_n``` is 1. I observe that in general, more trees generate better performance. The performance is better when randomly selelecting 3 predictors and the minimal node size has little effects on perofrmance.

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(rand_tune_res),desc(mean))
```

The best ```roc_auc``` is 0.726 and is achieved when ```mtry``` is 2 and ```trees``` is 256 and ```min_n``` is 1.

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

```{r}
best_rand_forest <- select_best(rand_tune_res)

rand_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(rand_tree_wf, best_rand_forest)

rand_tree_final_fit <- fit(rand_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

vip(rand_tree_final_fit %>% extract_fit_engine())
```

We see from the plot that ```sp_alk``` is the most useful variable and ```legendary``` is the least useful variable. ```attack```, ```defense```, ```speed```, ```hp```, and ```sp_def``` are equally useful.

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

What do you observe?

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
boost_tree_spec <- boost_tree(trees = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

boost_tree_grid <- grid_regular(trees(c(10,2000)),levels = 10)

boost_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(boost_tree_spec) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~  legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense+ hp+sp_def)

boost_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  boost_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = boost_tree_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc),
)
 
autoplot(boost_tune_res)
```

I see that ```roc_auc``` increases at the beginning as trees increases. It reaches the peak at 673 trees and decreases at the end. 

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(boost_tune_res),desc(mean))
```

The best roc_auc is 0.699 and is see at 673 trees.

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

We first collect the best tree from boosted tree

```{r}
best_boost_tree <- select_best(boost_tune_res)

boost_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(boost_tree_wf, best_boost_tree)

boost_tree_final_fit <- fit(boost_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

```

```{r}
final_rand_model = augment(rand_tree_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_train)
final_class_model = augment(class_tree_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_train)
final_boost_model = augment(boost_tree_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_train)

results<- bind_rows(
  roc_auc(final_rand_model, truth = type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic),
  roc_auc(final_class_model, truth = type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic),
  roc_auc(final_boost_model, truth = type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic) 
)
results
```


So we see that the best model has roc_auc of 0.799, and is achieved by the randomforest model.

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

```{r}
final_rand_model_test = augment(rand_tree_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test)
roc_auc(final_rand_model_test, truth = type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic)
```

As we see from the above table, the model achieve a 0.659 roc_auc value on the testing set.

```{r}
conf_mat(final_rand_model_test, truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>% #calclate confusion matri 
autoplot(type = "heatmap") + #autoplot with a heatmap
theme_bw() + #change theme
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust=1)) #rotate x axis labels
```

```{r}
 autoplot(roc_curve(final_rand_model_test, truth = type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic))
```

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

The model is most accurate at predicting normal and fire pokemons and is worst at predicting psychic pokemons.

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
  
```{r}
abalone <- read_csv(file = "data/abalone.csv")
abalone <- abalone %>% 
  mutate(age = rings + 1.5)
abalone_split <- abalone %>% initial_split(strata = age, 
                                           prop = 0.70)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)

abalone_folds <- vfold_cv(abalone_train, v = 5,strata = age)

abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~ . , data = abalone_train) %>% 
  step_rm(rings) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ starts_with("type"):shucked_weight +
                  longest_shell:diameter + 
                  shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
  
rand_tree_spec_abalone <- rand_forest(
  mode = "regression",
  mtry = tune(),
  trees = tune(),
  min_n = tune()
) %>%
set_engine("ranger") 

rand_tree_grid_abalone <- grid_regular(mtry(c(1,8)),trees(c(16,256)),min_n(c(1,8)),levels = 8)

rand_tree_wf_abalone <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rand_tree_spec_abalone) %>%
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe) 

rand_tune_res_abalone <- tune_grid(
  rand_tree_wf_abalone, 
  resamples = abalone_folds, 
  grid = rand_tree_grid_abalone, 
)
autoplot(rand_tune_res_abalone)
```

So we see that with higher number of trees, the lower the rmse and the higher the rsq. The ```mtry``` and ```min_n``` has little effect on prediction.

```{r}
best_rand_forest_abalone <- select_best(rand_tune_res_abalone)

rand_tree_final_abalone <- finalize_workflow(rand_tree_wf_abalone, best_rand_forest_abalone)

rand_tree_final_fit_abalone <- fit(rand_tree_final_abalone, data = abalone_train)

multi_metric <- metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae)
abalone_predict <- predict(rand_tree_final_fit_abalone, abalone_test) %>% 
  bind_cols(abalone_test %>% select(age))
multi_metric(abalone_predict, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
```

So the model has ```rmse``` with 2.18 on the testing set, which is acceptible since this is similar performance to the training data.
